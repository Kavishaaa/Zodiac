# Zodiac
This Java project determines a user's zodiac sign based on their birth month and date. It prompts the user to enter their birth details, then identifies their corresponding zodiac sign. The program also offers the option to display interesting facts about the user's zodiac sign. The zodiac facts are stored in a `HashMap`, and the signs are matched using conditional checks.
All the facts are taken from websites online.
